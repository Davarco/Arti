# Arti

Arti is an Android application that uses the [AlgoBot API](http://https://github.com/Davarco/AlgoBot) to buy/sell stocks in an _artificial_ environment using _real historical_ data.

## Installation and Usage

**Requirements:**

 - An Android device running 4.0+ with Developer Mode enabled.
 - Make sure you have the necessary permissions to install applications from unauthorized sources.

In addition, you will require an internet connection to connect to the AlgoBot Server to fetch stock data.

**Usage:**

Using **Add Stock** in the app's overflow menu, add the stocks you wish the app to trade. Then, sit back and watch yourself make money (in an artificial environment). Additionally, you can use the News tab to conveniently browse Google News for any insight into the stocks you are trading. That way, you can remove certain stocks if you foresee a loss.
