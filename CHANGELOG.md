## v1.2.0

 - Fixed an issue caused by SQLite Database persistence. **Updating to this version will clear all existing data.**
 - Other minor bug fixes.
 
## v1.1.2

 - Temporary fix for SQLite Database persistence. You probably won't find this version anywhere anytime soon.
 
## v1.1.1

 - Minor bug fixes.
 
## v1.1.0

 - Implemented the Bank screen so you can actually perform the tasks the app was supposed to help you perform.
 - In some cases, this version tries to use an autosaved database from the previous version. However, the database here was updated without being cleared, so if you've used this app before, this version likely won't work for you. Try a more recent release :)

## v1.0.0

 - First public release. Fairly bug free, but doesn't include even half of the features we want it to have.
 - Add stocks to watch, and search up some news on the News screen!
 
## v0.1.0

 - Internal beta. Stock-watch implemented, news screen created with placeholders.
